## Mentoring Plan

### Model List

- Classification Models
    - Logistic Regression
    - Desicion Tree
    - Multinomian NB
    - SVM
    - SGDClassifier

### Approach

The data is random content from Wikipedia in ~10 different languages. The idea is to build a classifiers that can identify the language of a sentence. Utilizing different kind of models and techniques, we are going to compare performance and try to identify most useful preposecing and hyper parameters.
